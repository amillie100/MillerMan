        "- Load the Airbnb dataset you cleaned and transformed in Assignment 7\n",
        "- Build a linear regression model to predict listing price\n",
        "- Interpret which features most affect price\n",
        "- Try to improve your model using only the most impactful predictors\n",
        "- Practice explaining your findings to a business audience like a host, pricing strategist, or city partner\n",

        "## Why This Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "Pricing is one of the most important levers for hosts and Airbnb’s business teams. Understanding what drives price — and being able to predict it accurately — helps improve search results, revenue management, and guest satisfaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "This assignment gives you hands-on practice turning a cleaned dataset into a predictive model. You’ll focus not just on code, but on what the results mean and how you’d communicate them to stakeholders.\n",

These features were selected because they showed the strongest absolute coefficients in the initial model, suggesting they had the most significant impact on price according to that model.\n",

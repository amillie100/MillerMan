        "In this assignment, you will:\n",
        "- Load the Airbnb dataset you cleaned in Assignment 6\n",
        "- Apply data transformation techniques like scaling, binning, encoding, and feature creation\n",
        "- Make the dataset easier to use for tasks like pricing analysis, guest segmentation, or listing recommendations\n",
        "- Practice writing up your analysis clearly so a business audience — like a host, marketing manager, or city partner — could understand it\n",

        "## Why This Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "Airbnb analysts, hosts, and city partners rely on clean and well-structured data to make smart decisions. Whether they’re adjusting prices, identifying high-performing listings, or designing better guest experiences, they need data that’s transformed, organized, and ready for use.\n",

        "1. I examined the price column.\n",
        "2. I applied a log transformation because the price distribution was heavily skewed to the right, with many low values and a few very high values. The log transformation helps to compress the range of values and make the distribution more symmetrical, which is beneficial for many statistical analyses and machine learning models.\n",
        "3. The transformed version helps make the data more usable by reducing the impact of outliers and making the distribution closer to normal. This makes it easier to visualize trends and make more meaningful summary statistics, and build more robust models for tasks like price prediction. For stakeholders, it allows for clearer insights into typical price ranges after accounting for extreme values."

Analysts could use the scaled values for visualizations that compare metrics on the same scale, making patterns easier to spot.

        "    - **`price_per_night`**: Calculated as `price` / `minimum_nights`. This represents the average cost for a single night's stay, taking into account the minimum night requirement.\n",
        "    - **`long_term_stay_flag`**: A binary flag (0 or 1) that is 1 if the `minimum_nights` is 30 or more, and 0 otherwise. This identifies listings primarily aimed at longer stays.\n",
        "2. **`price_per_night`** would be used by hosts, analysts, and the platform. `long_term_stay_flag`  would primarily be used by analysts and the platform, though hosts could benefit from understanding this segmentation.\n",
        "3. These new columns can help someone make a better decision in several ways:\n",
        "    Hosts: By looking at `price_per_night`, hosts can better understand their pricing relative to the length of stay required and compare it to other listings. The `long_term_stay_flag` can help them identify if their listing's minimum stay aligns with market demand for long term rentals.\n",
        "    Analysts: `price_per_night` provides a standardized metric to compare the cost effectiveness of different listings, regardless of their minimum stay. The `long_term_stay_flag` allows analysts to easily segment the market and analyze the characteristics and performance of listings targeting long term guests versus short term guests. This helps in market analysis and identifying trends.\n",

        "1. I encoded the `room_type` column. I chose this column because it's a categorical variable that is relevant for understanding listing characteristics and is commonly used in predictive models.\n",
        "2. I used one-hot encoding. This method is suitable because `room_type` is a nominal categorical variable; there is no ranking between the different room types. One-hot encoding creates new binary columns for each unique category, which can be directly used in most machine learning algorithms.\n",
        "3. This transformation is crucial for helping a pricing model, dashboard, or business report because:\n",
        "    Pricing Model: Machine learning models typically require numerical input. One-hot encoding converts the categorical `room_type` into a numerical format that the model can understand and use to identify how different room types influence pricing.\n",
        "    Dashboard: On a dashboard, instead of just showing the count of each room type, you could use the one-hot encoded columns to filter data, compare average prices or availability across room types, or visualize the distribution of room types in different neighborhoods.\n",
        "    Business Report: In a business report, you can easily present the proportion of each room type or analyze the performance metrics for each room type category, providing clear insights to stakeholders."

        "1. The log transformation of the price column felt most important. Price is a key metric for both hosts and guests, and its heavily skewed distribution in raw form makes it challenging to analyze accurately. Transforming it allows for more reliable statistical analysis and modeling, providing a clearer picture of typical pricing and the impact of other factors on price.\n",
        "2. To a Host: The **`price_per_night`** variable would be most useful. It provides a simple metric to compare their listing's value proposition against others, helping them set competitive prices and understand guest expectations based on the minimum stay.\n",
        "    - To an Analyst: The scaled columns (`minimum_nights_minmax_scaled` and `number_of_reviews_zscore_scaled`) and the one-hot encoded `room_type` columns would be most useful. These are essential for building robust predictive models and for conducting analyses that require comparing features on a similar scale.\n",
        "    - To a City Planner: The **`long_term_stay_flag`** and potentially the grouped `review_volume_category` could be most useful. City planners might be interested in understanding the prevalence of long-term rentals in different areas or identifying areas with high review activity, which could indicate popular tourist spots or areas with high resident satisfaction.\n",
        "3. If I were going to build a tool or dashboard, I would next focus on exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the transformed data. I would look for correlations between the new features and key metrics like booking rate or review scores. I would also create visualizations that leverage the scaled and encoded data to show trends and comparisons across different listing types and locations. This EDA would inform the design of a dashboard that provides actionable insights to hosts and analysts, perhaps focusing on optimizing pricing or improving guest experience based on the transformed features.\n",
        "4. This assignment directly relates to my customized learning outcome focused on \"Applying data cleaning and transformation techniques to prepare real world datasets for analysis and visualization.\" By loading, cleaning (from Assignment 6), and now transforming this Airbnb dataset, I have practiced essential skills in handling messy, real world data. The transformations performed scaling, binning, encoding, and feature creation—are fundamental steps in making data ready for further analysis, modeling, and creating informative visualizations or reports, which aligns perfectly with my goal of preparing data for practical use."
